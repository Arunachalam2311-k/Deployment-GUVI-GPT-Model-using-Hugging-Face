Deployment GUVI GPT Model using Hugging Face

# Project Overview
This project involves deploying a GPT model that has been fine-tuned for GUVI using Hugging Face. The goal is to make this model accessible and usable via a web interface or API.

# Objectives 
Fine-Tune the GPT Model: Customize the GPT model according to the specific needs of GUVI.
Deploy the Model: Utilize Hugging Face's deployment tools to host and manage the model.
Provide Access: Ensure that users can interact with the model through a web interface or API.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

Python version 3.7 or higher
Pip for installing packages
Virtual environment setup (recommended for managing dependencies)
Installation
Clone the Repository: Obtain the project files from the repository.
Set Up a Virtual Environment: Create and activate a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries and tools required for the project.
Model Fine-Tuning
# To fine-tune the GPT model:

Prepare the Dataset: Ensure that your training data is formatted and ready for the model.
Train the Model: Adjust the model’s parameters and train it using the prepared dataset.
Save the Model: Once training is complete, save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer.
Deployment
# For deploying the fine-tuned model:

Upload to Hugging Face: Log into Hugging Face and upload the model to their platform.
Configure Deployment: Set up the deployment settings to make the model accessible through Hugging Face's services.
Usage
# To interact with the deployed model:

Web Interface: Access the model via a web interface if provided, usually by navigating to a specified URL.
API Access: Use the available API endpoints to send requests to the model and receive responses.
Testing
To ensure the model and deployment are working correctly:

# Run Tests:
 Execute any predefined tests to verify the model’s functionality.
Manual Testing: Check the web interface or API manually to ensure that everything is operating as expected.
